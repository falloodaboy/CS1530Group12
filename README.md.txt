Welcome to the CS1530 Group 12 Repo. This repo is for Group 12 for designing a video game as an exercise using the Agile Methodology.

The way this repo is designed to work is that only the Merge Master can authorize changes to the master branch using Pull Requests

and that each feature of the game is developed in a separate branch and then merged after the branch owner and merge master work

through all of the code details. 

Merge Master: TBD
